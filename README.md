# Snek Game Tkinter

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's Tkinter library. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer with each piece consumed. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features
- Basic snake movement and controls using the arrow keys.
- Growing snake length as it eats food.
- Dynamic scoring system.
- Game over condition upon collision with walls or self.
- Difficulty increases as the snake grows and speed increases.
